|: bitwise OR                                {: bit shift to left
~: bitwise NOT                               }: bit shift to right
```
Note: 4 commands of BF('+', '-', '.', ',') are changed to 'i', 'd', 'p', 'g'. But 'i' and 'd' work a little bit different because they can also be used to increment/decrement the value of 32b integer and 64b double. Here's the example of BF Hello, world program translated into ABF.
```

Syntax
---
*** Note ***
In the descriptions of the example codes below, "mem" is a representation of memory in a form of unsigned char array.

Handling Argument(s)
- Every calculations' operand(s) is/are value at address X and/or adresss Y.
- Argument type of commands except for 'w' are int(unsigned/signed type depends on pointer mode).
- 'w'command's argument type is int when pointer type is char or int, and signed int or double when pointer type is double. Unsigned/signed type depends on pointer mode.
- Arguments must be written right after a command without space or anything else.
- Size of arguments are 4 Bytes when pointer type is int/char, and 8 bytes when pointer type is double.
- Arguments must be separated using ','.
```
Example: a0,5 ; *mem && *(mem + 5)
```
- If non-last argument is not given, argument will set to current address.
```
Example: $+,1000 ; *(mem + addr) + *(mem + 1000)
```
- If last argument is ',', argument will set to current address.
```
Example: $m1000,, ; *(mem + addr) = *(mem + 1000)
```
  
Data and pointer processing
- size of char is 1B, size of int is 4B, and size of double is 8B For 32bit and 64bit systems.
- Pointer type and signed/unsigned will be maintained without specific commands including 'k'.
- Product of calculations except for shift calculations('{' and '}') will be stored in buffer. To save the product to memory, you must set correct pointer type and use '=' command.
```
Example: f0w100f1w250-1,0f2= ;buffer = *(mem + 1) - *mem; *(mem + 2) = buffer;
```
- Address is set byte-wise. pointer type has no effect.
- Every data read/write starts from the byte at the current pointer/address.
```
Example: #f5w255 ;write int type data from address 5 to 8. Byte value from 5 to 8: 0xff000000(little-endian)
```
- The type check of the value stored in the memory will NOT performed.
```
Example: '#f0w2147483647$f2w0 ;value from 0 to 3: 0xffff007f(little-endian)
```
- '\\' command reads and outputs the value as much as the length corresponding to the pointer type. In the case of a double pointer, the value is converted to an integer and output.
- '_' command reads and outputs the value in floating-point type as much as the length of double type.
- '/' command calculates quotient if pointer type is not double.
- ':' command ALWAYS saves product to buffer in signed char type.
- When checking conditions for if statement, interpreter reads and compares data in previously set pointer type.
```
Example:'#c10,32,!(f0\) ;if int value at address 10 to 13 is not equal to value at address 32 to 35 then f0\
```
- Bit-wise operations(except for shift) and modulus are prohibited when double pointer is active.
- '=' command saves the value at buffer to current pointer according to the pointer type. The operation result and size stored in the buffer are affected by the command and pointer mode, and unexpected behavior may occur if the operation value stored in the buffer is read with the wrong pointer type. The':' command writes the operation result to the first byte of the buffer in signed char format, while other commands write the operation result as much as the size of data type from the first part of the buffer.
```
Note: these data examples are in little-endian.
Data stored in buffer after z'#f0w15f4w31f8:0,4 :
ff 00 00 00 0f 00 00 00 1f 00 00 00 ... 00
Data stored in buffer after z'#f0w15f4w31f8+0,4 :
2e 00 00 00 0f 00 00 00 1f 00 00 00 ... 00
Date stored in buffer after z'$f0w15f4w31f8+0,4 :
2e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ... 00
```
Command usage and syntax
- Before if statement, conditions must be defined using 'c' command.
- 'c' command needs 3 arguments. Argument order is: X, Y, comparative/logical operation command.
```
Example: c0,2,!(...) ;if (*mem != *(mem + 2)) {...}
```
- Among the operators passed as arguments to the 'c' command, '~' and 'n' require only one argument for calculation. Internally, they use the value of address X, so argument Y will be ignored. You can pass arguments in two ways.
```
Method 1: c1,1,n(...) ;if (! *(mem + 1)) {...}
Method 2: c1,,n(...)
```
- 'b' command stops command execution and starts it from next ']'.
- pointer(address) incrementation and decrementation will not be affected by the pointer type.
- 'i' and 'd' increments/decrements data value. These commands are affected by the pointer type. 
- 'e' and '!' are comparative operator. They return 1 if condition is true, and 0 if condition is false.
- 'g' command uses stdin.
- 'h' command returns error code and halts program execution. Error code's type is unsigned int.
```
Example, z'h100w65p is written in the file which is being executed.
READY(0,0000)>> s
Program handled error(100)
READY(0,0000)>> 
```
- 'j' can only be used in file executions. To use this command you must define line number in BASIC style.
```
;Example
10 f0w65
20 p
30 j20 ;jumps to 20 and create infinite loop, printing 'A'.
```
- line number is not essential. You can skip writing line number if jump to that line won't be happend.
```
;Example
10 z'$
20 j50
30 v
f0w88pzt
50 f0w65pw0j30
;execution order: 10 -> 20 -> 50 -> 30 -> "f0w88pzt"
```
- 'k' command initializes pointer type, internal buffers, settings, etc. However, the file remains open.
- 'm' command is affected by pointer type.
- 'p' command prints current byte value as char.
- 'q' command cannot be used without loading a file. Also it cannot be used in file(s).
- 'r' command is return. codes in the next line of the line stored in line number buffer by 'y' command will be executed.
```
;Example
10 z'$
20 yj100 ;save line number "20" to line number buffer, then jump to 100
25 c,,e() ;starts from here after 'r' at 110
30 f0zt

100 f0w90>w64[ipc0,1,e(b)] ;print ABCDE...XYZ
110 r ;return to the next line of "20"
```
- 't' command is used for terminating file execution without error. It does not return error code.
- Any characters after 't' will be considered as remarks/comments.
- 'v' executes commands at the next line.
- 'y' command saves current BASIC style position to position buffer.
- Nested if and loop are supported.
- Subroutine can be implemented in file(s) using 'j', 'r', 'y' commands. Please refer to Example programs.
- When loading a file, you must put '`' before and after the directory and name of the file.
```
Example1: l`c:\abf\prg.abf` ;Windows
Example2: l`/abf/prg.abf`   ;Linux
```
- '/' command uses the value at X as numerator, and the value at Y as denominator.
- Any characters after ';' and in the same line will be considered as remarks/comments.
- ':' command stores -1(0xff) if the value at X is less than the value at Y, 0 if it is equal, 1(0x01) if it is greater.
- '{' and '}' are shift operators. They shift bit value to left or right. These operators are affected by pointer type. Unlike the other bit-wise operators, these operators can be used when the double pointer is active.
- Corresponding brackets and parentheses must be in the same line
```
z'$f0w100>[ip<d>] ;Correct
z'$f0w100>[ip<
d>]               ;Wrong!
```

Interpreter
---
Interpreter is written in C language. Please let me know if you find any bug(s).

I am just a hobbyist, therefore the source code may be complicated to read and/or have bugs. The descriptions below are based on tests performed on MS Windows(x86) Environment. Note: Interpreter built by gcc and tested on Debian linux.

- Specifications

Memory available: 65535 Bytes

Command buffer: 4096 Bytes including null

File name length limit: 1024 Bytes including null

Size of int: 4 Bytes(system dependant)

Size of double: 8 Bytes(system dependant)

Data types supported: char, unsigned char, int, unsigned int, double

- Introduction

The win32 interpreter is built to run on Windows x86 systems. If you are not using an x86 or x86_64 environment, or if you are using Linux, you must build the source code yourself.

When you start the interpreter, the following screen is displayed.
```
Ascii BrainFuck Language Interpreter Prompt
int size: 4 Bytes, double size: 8 Bytes
int range: -2147483648 to 2147483647, double range: (+-) 2.22507385851e-308 to 1.79769313486e+308
Memory size: 65535 Bytes
Maximum command length per line: 4096 Bytes including null
Maximum file name length: 1024 Bytes including null
Byte order is Little endian.
***Type ? for commands***

READY(0,00000)>>
```
When the interpreter is started, the size and range of the int and double data types are displayed as shown in the screen above. It also prints the size of memory, size of commands that can be entered per line, and endianness.
When the interpreter processed command(s) and waits for the next command, the following is output:
```
READY(x,yyyyy)>>
```
x represents the current pointer mode. There are 5 pointer modes: 0: char, 1: int, 2: double, 3: unsigned char, and 4: unsigned int.
yyyyy represents the current memory address in decimal.

When loading a file, you must specify a path and extension. The output values are different when loading and executing a file on one line and when executing the next line after loading a file. As an example, if you load and run the hw.abf file, the following output is displayed.
```
READY(0,00000)>> l`c:\abf\hw.abf`
File Loaded c:\abf\hw.abf
READY(0,00000)>> s
Hello, world

READY(0,00014)>> ku

READY(0,00000)>> l`c:\abf\hw.abf`s
File Loaded c:\abf\hw.abfHello, world
```
As in the example, if both loading and execution are processed on one line, the output of the program is output without line breaks. On the other hand, if you run the file on the next line after loading, you can see that "Hello, world" is displayed normally.

If an error occurs during command execution, an error message is displayed and the command execution is stopped. If the file is running, the file will stop being executed. An example error message is as follows:
```
READY(0,00000)>> `
?Error name marker without command. cmd at 0, line 0
READY(0,00000)>>
```
The error message specifies where the error occurred in the command, such as "cmd at 0, line 0". If line is 0, an error occurred while entering and executing a command in the interpreter without loading a file. Error messages are output in the format "?Error ...".

Before executing the command, the interpreter checks whether the number of opening and closing parts of the parentheses () of the if statement and the brackets [] of the loop statement are the same. If the number of open parts and the number of closed parts do not match, the following error message is displayed.
```
READY(0,00000)>> []]
?Error parentheses and/or brackets are not balanced
READY(0,00000)>>
```
In the interpreter, the 'g' command performs the same function as MSVC's non-standard function _getch(). In other words, as soon as a character is entered on the keyboard, the value is stored in the memory. However, if the operating system is not MS Windows or Linux, the 'g' command may not be executed normally. In this case, the user must modify the source code and implement it.

When writing a value to memory as an int or double type, the interpreter checks that the memory range is not exceeded. The maximum value of the memory address is 65534. If an address exceeding 65531 for int and 65527 for double is set, the maximum value of memory address is exceeded and an error message is displayed.
```
READY(1,65531)>> w5647

READY(1,65531)>> >w5647
?Error address out of range. cmd at 1, line 0
READY(1,65532)>> @f65527w2.2

READY(2,65527)>> >w2.2
?Error address out of range. cmd at 1, line 0
READY(2,65528)>>
```
If the pointer mode is double, an error message is output if the bitwise operator and modulus operator are used.
```
READY(0,00000)>> @%1,10
?Error modulus operation in floating point format. cmd at 1, line 0
READY(2,00000)>> @|1,10
?Error bitwise operation in floating point format(|). cmd at 1, line 0
READY(2,00000)>>
```
If you use the 'w' command while using an int or double pointer, the interpreter does not check the size of the input value.

If the interpreter receives an error from the program, it displays an error code and then stops executing the program.
```
READY(0,00000)>> s

Program handled error(-1)
READY(0,00000)>>
```
The operation result stored in the buffer is retained unless a command that changes the value of the buffer is executed. After performing an operation using this behavior, you can save the operation result in multiple addresses in the memory.
```
READY(0,00000)>> w1>w2:0,1>=\>=\
-1-1
READY(0,00003)>>
```
